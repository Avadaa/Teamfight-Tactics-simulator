The interface is not ideal, but gets the job done.

## UNITS
Two teams: blue (bottom) and red (the top one)

Choose units to both sides of the field using the top dropdown menu which exists for each of the hexes.
Any unit can be set to have 4 stars, but others than the ones of 'moonlight' -trait will crash the program.

Choose items for the units if you so wish. The limitations that exist in game are not a problem here. You can have three "thieve's gloves" if you want to. You can have a tirple elderwoord nunu which means that your elderwood count would be 4.

Pro tip: open a dropdown menu and type a character to jump closer to your desired champion / item. Makes filling these things a lot faster.

The 'chosen' -input is not required to be filled. You can give a champion ANY trait. You can have as many chosens as you wish. Type the trait in a singular form. Example: "keeper" (without the quotations)

The 'azir' -input is to be filled ONLY for sandguards. Since the guards' lives are tied to their daddy, you have to set the right Azir's location manually. The coordinates start from bottom left as (0, 0), and move one at the time. The last of the bottom row would be (0,6). The top right is (7,6). The syntax for the Azir's coordinates is "y x" without the quotes. 


## UI
After filling up the teams press the green button to generate the team data. Copy it. Run 'main.py'. Paste the data to the 'Team data' -input field. Fill the amount of iterations you want (how many rounds the comp will run). Press the 'Run simulations' -button to start the process. You can stop the simulations at any time by pressing the 'Stop' -button.
